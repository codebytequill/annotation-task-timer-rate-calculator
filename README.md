Annotation Task Timer & Rate Calculator
A powerful, single-file web tool for freelance data annotators to track their time with precision, understand the true cost of their labor, and calculate fair per-task rates based on a target hourly wage.

The Problem This Solves
The "pennies-per-task" model common in the data annotation industry often obscures the actual time and effort required for high-quality work. This can lead to freelancers being significantly underpaid. This tool combats that problem by providing you with personal, undeniable data about your own workflow. Instead of guessing your effective hourly rate, you can measure it, and then use that data to negotiate better terms or choose more profitable projects.

Features
Simple & Focused UI: A clean, two-column layout that makes tracking and analysis straightforward.

Target Rate Calculation: Set your desired hourly rate, and the tool automatically calculates the fair per-task price for each category of work.

Dynamic Task Categories: Create, manage, and remove categories for different types of annotation tasks (e.g., "Simple Bounding Box," "Complex Polygon," "Medical Image Segmentation").

Accurate Task Timer: A simple Start/Stop timer to accurately measure the time spent on any given task.

One-Click Logging: Log a completed task's time to its category with a single button press, automatically updating your averages.

Persistent Local Storage: All your data—categories, logged tasks, and target rate—is saved in your browser's local storage. You can close the tab and your data will be there when you return.

Zero Installation: It's a single HTML file. No servers, no complex setup. Just download and run.

How to Use
Download & Open: Save the rate_calculator_tool.html file to your computer and open it in any web browser.

Set Your Rate: In the "Setup" box, enter your desired Target Hourly Rate. This is the foundation for all calculations.

Create Categories: In the "Task Categories" box, add the different types of annotation work you do. Be as specific as you like! Click the + button to add each one.

Time a Task:

Select the appropriate category from the dropdown menu under the "Timer" section.

Click the Start button when you begin a task.

Click the Stop button when you pause or finish. You can start and stop as many times as you need for a single task.

Log Your Work: Once a task is complete and the timer is stopped, click the "Log Task & Reset" button. This will:

Add the elapsed time to the selected category.

Update the "Tasks Logged," "Avg. Time/Task," and "Fair Rate/Task" in the analysis table.

Reset the timer to 00:00:00, ready for the next task.

Analyze Your Data: The "Analysis & Results" table is your negotiation tool. After logging several tasks in a category, you will have a data-backed "Fair Rate/Task" to use in discussions with clients.

Reset (If Needed): The "Reset All Data" button will clear everything from local storage if you want to start fresh.

The Data-Driven Approach to Fair Pay
With this tool, you are no longer just accepting a rate; you are measuring your work against it. If a client offers $0.10 for a task that you've measured to take an average of 1 minute, you can see that your effective hourly rate is only $6/hour.

Armed with this data, you can confidently:

Negotiate for higher per-task rates.

Politely decline projects that are not profitable.

Focus your efforts on clients and task types that respect your time and skill.
